Antigravity Project Prompt

Project name: GymTick
Type: Mobile-first web app (PWA)
Goal: Ultra-simple workout completion tracking app (tick-based, no heavy logging)

Product Vision

Build a minimal, fast, distraction-free gym workout logging app.

The app should behave like:

> Open → See today’s workout → Tick exercises → Workout logged → Close app



No typing during workouts.
No complex analytics.
No social features.
No clutter.

This is a “to-do list for the gym”.

Great idea. You’re basically describing “frictionless workout completion tracking” — not planning, not analytics-heavy coaching, just execute → tick → move on. That’s exactly where Notion and most fitness apps fail.

Below is a curated, product-thinking breakdown you can directly use to design your platform.


---

1. Why existing tools fail (Notion & fitness apps)

Notion problems

❌ Too many clicks (open workspace → database → filter → edit row → save)

❌ Not designed for “in-the-gym” usage (small buttons, typing required)

❌ Manual structure setup

❌ Slow to load

❌ No offline reliability

❌ Feels like work, not training


Fitness app problems

❌ Overloaded with features (macros, social, videos, coaching, AI)

❌ Too many decisions during workout

❌ Logging sets/reps/weight is tedious

❌ Requires constant interaction

❌ Pushes notifications & upsells

❌ Bad UX for “just confirm I did it”



---

2. Your product philosophy (core principle)

> Zero cognitive load. One tap. Continue training.



Your app should feel like:

> “Open → See today → Tap done → Close”



No typing. No scrolling. No thinking.


---

3. Core user flow (perfect minimal flow)

Before gym (setup – rare)

User creates:

Weekly schedule (Push / Pull / Legs)

Or specific workouts (Chest Day, Back Day, etc.)


Assigns days


At gym (main experience – daily)

1. Open app


2. Automatically shows:

> “Today: Push Day”




3. Big button: ✅ Start


4. Shows workout checklist:

Bench Press

Incline DB Press

Triceps Pushdown



5. User taps checkbox after each exercise


6. When last item checked: 🎉 “Workout complete”


7. Auto-log timestamp


8. App closes




---

4. Common friction points to eliminate

Problem	Your solution

Typing during workout	No typing
Tracking sets/reps	Optional / hidden
Multiple screens	Single screen
Complex dashboards	No dashboards
Social features	None
Notifications	Only optional reminders
Editing plans often	Simple templates
Internet dependency	Offline first



---

5. Feature set (MVP)

Must have

Workout templates

Weekly schedule

Today view

Exercise checklist

Auto log completion

History (calendar or list)

Offline support

Fast startup (<1s)


Nice later

Streak counter

Weight tracking (optional)

Simple stats (workouts/week)

Dark mode

Apple Watch / Wear OS


Avoid initially

Social

Macros

Videos

AI coaching

Marketplaces

Messaging



---

6. UI layout (single-screen concept)

--------------------------------
| Today: Push Day              |
| Monday, Jan 13               |
--------------------------------

[ ] Bench Press
[ ] Incline Dumbbell Press
[ ] Shoulder Press
[ ] Triceps Pushdown

-------------------------------
|      COMPLETE WORKOUT       |
-------------------------------

When all checked → auto logs.


---

7. Data model (simple)

User
WorkoutTemplate
  - name
  - exercises[]

Schedule
  - day → workoutTemplateId

WorkoutLog
  - date
  - workoutTemplateId
  - completedExercises[]
  - completedAt


---

8. Differentiation statement

Your app is:

> “Todo list for the gym.”



Not:

Trainer

Coach

Social network

Spreadsheet



---

9. Name ideas

TickLift

DoneGym

RepDone

GymTick

LiftLog (minimal version)

CheckFit

SetDone



---

10. Validation strategy (before building)

Ask 10 gym-goers:

> “Would you use an app that only shows today’s workout and lets you tick it off in 10 seconds?”



If 7+ say yes → build.


---

11. Tech suggestion (optional)

Stack

Frontend: React Native / Flutter

Storage: Local SQLite

Sync later: Firebase/Supabase

Offline-first



---

12. Expansion ideas (future)

Wearable one-tap logging

Gym NFC check-in auto complete

Voice “Workout done”

Automatic rest timer

Program templates marketplace
